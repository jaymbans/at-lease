## Where Alumni & Students Connect!
At Lease at Ease is a demo site that provides a market for Alumni to sublet their apartments to current undergraduate students

<br>
While I was in undergrad, I always wished their was an easier way for students to obtain short term leases. I had an internship each year whilst I was in college, and I was lucky enough to have grown up in New York.

I was able to stay at my parents place, and commute each day to work. Many of my friends did not have this luxury. They would have to find last minute apartments, which were extremely over priced - or longer term than what they needed for the duration of the internship.

Upon graduating, my friends and I are often looking for opportunities to travel - as many of us work remotely. We wish we could sublet our apartments to someone we know and trust.

<h4>At Lease at Ease is a two-fold mission. To...</h4>
<ol>
<li>Provide current undergraduate students to have a place to stay at a discounted rate</li>
<li>Allow alumni to lease their apartments short-term to a trusted individual</li>
</ol>
